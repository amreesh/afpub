1.  Introduction

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

1.2.  What Is This Document?

   This document is a sample guideline for an operational manual to
   accompany the AFRINIC Policy submitted as AFPUB-2017-DNS001-00,
   should it proceed through the AFRINIC Policy Development Process.

   The authors are aware that there is significant work to be done to
   implement the policy should it pass.  They provide this _guideline_
   for implementation to AFRINIC staff to use, should they choose.

2.  Sample Policy Implementation Procedure

2.1.  Scope

   This procedure applies to each "nserver" record within "domain"
   objects in the AFRINIC WHOIS database.  The relationship between
   "domain" objects to "nserver" records is one-to-many.

2.2.  Definition of 'LAME'

   For the purpose of this policy implementation, a DNS nameserver is
   considered lame if, when queried using a standard DNS client or
   library, the server does not respond back with an authoritative
   answer for the specific domain.

   No differentiation is here made between the behaviour of the DNS
   server:

   o  Not responding at all.

   o  Responding in some way, but not for the specific domain queried.

   o  Responding for the correct domain, but without the authority bit
      set.

   _With all the three of the above, the server is considered equally as
   'lame'._

2.3.  Detection, Notification and Removal

2.3.1.  'Lameness' Checking Method

   Tests will be run on a monthly basis on all nameservers found as
   "nserver" records within "doamin" objects in the AFRINIC WHOIS
   Database.  Checks will be run from at least two different
   geographical locations, with each site using both address families
   (ie.  IPv4 and IPv6).

   _Any single successful recorded authoritative answer for a single
   address family, or from a single test location is sufficient to NOT
   consider the nameserver as lame._

2.3.2.  Timeline for Handling Lame Delegations

   +----------+------------+-------------------------------------------+
   | Timeline |   Event    |                  Actions                  |
   +----------+------------+-------------------------------------------+
   |  Day 0   |    Lame    |  Lame delegation is recorded. Nameserver  |
   |          | delegation |  is re-tested for lame delegation every 3 |
   |          |  is first  |                   days.                   |
   |          | detected.  |                                           |
   |  Day 15  | Delegation |   A remark is added in the domain object  |
   |          |  is still  |      for the lame nameservers. Email      |
   |          |  detected  |   notification is sent every 5 days for   |
   |          |  as lame   |    another 15 days (3 notifications) to   |
   |          |  (after 5  |      "Admin-C", "Tech-C" and "Zone-C"     |
   |          | additional |  contacts. Lameness checks are still run  |
   |          |  checks).  | every 3 days. If a nameserver is not lame |
   |          |            |    anymore, the corresponding remark is   |
   |          |            |                  removed.                 |
   |  Day 30  | Delegation |  The "nserver" record is removed from all |
   |          |  is still  |    "domain" objects containing it. Any    |
   |          |   lame.    |     "domain" object that thus has zero    |
   |          |            |   "nserver" records, is removed from the  |
   |          |            |   WHOIS database. "Admin-C" and "Tech-C"  |
   |          |            |  contacts are notified of all changes. In |
   |          |            |    all instances the original "domain"    |
   |          |            |            object is archived.            |
   +----------+------------+-------------------------------------------+

2.3.3.  Object Archival

   All nameserver records and domain objects removed from the visible
   WHOIS database should be viewable on the MyAFRINIC portal for a
   period of 90 days.  After 90 days, the archived version will be
   discarded permanently.

2.3.4.  Consequences of Domain Objects Removal

   Should all the "nserver" records for a given domain object be
   removed, the domain object must be completely removed, as the nserver
   record is a mandatory field for the domain object template.

   Subsequent DNS lookup of the removed domains in the DNS will be
   answered by an NXDOMAIN response, meaning this domain is not listed
   in any AFRINIC arpa DNS zone.

2.3.5.  Reporting

   General lame delegation reports should to be published monthly.  In
   addition, a report on lame delegation _cleanup_ should be produced at
   least twice a year.

2.3.6.  Lameness Verification

   AFRINIC should put in place a public lameness checker tool.  And new
   nameserver entries for domain objects could be systematically checked
   for lameness prior to data going into the public WHOIS database.

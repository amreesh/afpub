1.  Introduction

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

2.  Problem Addressed by this Policy

2.1.  Background: What is "Lame Delegation"?

   In the DNS, generally, a lame delegation is a type of error that
   results when a name server which is designated as the authoritative
   server for a domain name, when queried, does not have authoritative
   data for that name.

2.2.  Impact of Lame Delegations in the Global DNS

   In the in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa zones, as applicable to this policy,
   the DNS records considered are NS records, delegating authority
   further down the chain of authority.

   With such a delegation resulting in a lame responses, the most
   obvious issue is complete failure for the specific .ARPA sub-zone
   that is being delegated to.

   This is similar to not having any delegations in place at all: The
   sub-set of .ARPA records cannot be found and so reverse DNS lookups
   will fail for that set of IP address resources.

   With no delegation in place, the failure is immediate and final.  The
   querying client for a particular zone will get a fast response from
   the parent zone's name-server, and do no further lookups.

   But comparing to a lame delegation, the client receives a referral to
   the lame (and invalid or broken) name-server(s).  It then has to look
   them up by name before then querying one or more for the originally
   requested record.

   If the first name-server in the set fails, the client may try the
   remainder, one by one if all are lame.

   In some cases the lameness is a result of non-authority or missing
   records, but in others the lame name-server is non-existent or
   unresponsive.  In these cases, the client also has to wait for a
   time-out before trying the next or failing.

   In summary, lame name-server delegations as compared to no delegation
   result in additional DNS traffic and a far greater time to respond
   for the client, with the same practical end outcome.

   In addition, the higher level parent zones that contain these useless
   and effectively invalid NS records are unnecessarily larger then
   needed.  There is also a potential impact on any statistical data
   drawn from the parent zone(s).

3.  How this Policy Addresses the Problem

3.1.  Summary

   This policy lays out a process to monitor for name-server records
   resulting in lame delegations, and a phased approach to removing
   these records from the DNS.

3.2.  Scope of the Policy

   This policy is intended to apply only to the DNS zones under in-
   addr.arpa and ip6.arpa managed by AFRINIC.  And should check the NS
   records as sourced from "domain" objects in the AFRINIC WHOIS
   database.

   More specifically, this policy is only applicable to reverse DNS
   delegations managed within the AFRINIC region for AFRINIC majority
   RIR IP allocations and assignments.

   This policy should not monitor or consider reverse DNS delegations
   for minority RIR IP address resources or legacy IP address resources.

4.  Policy to address lame DNS delegations

4.1.  Process Detail

4.1.1.  Monitoring / Checking

   All "domain" objects in the AFRINIC WHOIS database must be
   periodically examined, and all "nserver" attributes extracted for
   checking.

   Each "nserver" found must be checked to:

   o  Respond to DNS queries.

   o  Reply with a valid SOA record for the domain it's associated with
      in the WHOIS database.

   This periodic checking should be automated.  The checks should be
   relatively frequent, but not so frequent as to cause any operational
   impact to either AFRINIC systems or the global DNS.

   It is recommended that when a name-server fails a check for the first
   time, this is initially just recorded.  Only after multiple lameness
   checks failing should a name-server be flagged for further action.

4.1.2.  Notification

   Once one or more name-servers are flagged as lame, a reasonable
   attempt must be made to contact the person(s) responsible for the
   "domain" object and the DNS delegation.

   It is recommended that all of the "admin-c", "tech-c" and "zone-c"
   contacts be tried in parallel.

   In addition, contact information may be extracted from associated
   "org" and/or "mnt-by" attributes when appropriate.

   Unanswered notification communications should also be re-tried more
   than once before moving on to further actions.

   It is recommended that the communication frequency, communication
   method(s) and number of attempts should be standardised and publicly
   documented.

4.1.3.  Delegation Removal

   Once a given name-server had been determined to be lame for a given
   DNS "domain", and reasonable attempts have been made to contact a
   responsible person, the name-server must then be removed from the
   given DNS "domain".

   The name-server must not be removed from all WHOIS objects and DNS
   zones, as it may not be uniformly lame for other zones is serves.

   Only those name-servers flagged as lame should be removed from a
   given domain.  The domain must _not_ have all "nserver" attributes
   removed.

   These removals should be automated.  An optional "remarks" line may
   be added to the domain record in the database.

4.1.4.  Re-instatement

   Once corrected or alternate name-servers are available for a given
   reverse DNS zone, the responsible person(s) would add delegation to
   them in the same way as a new delegation is done for a new IP
   assignment or allocation.

   This process is found in the AFRINIC document "How to request reverse
   delegation in AFRINIC region? [2]".

5.  Further Information

5.1.  Similar policies in other regions

   o  ARIN: Policy 2002-1: Lame Delegations in IN-ADDR.ARPA [3]

   o  APNIC: prop-038: Amending APNIC's lame DNS reverse delegation
      policy [4]

   o  LACNIC: Lame Delegation Policy within the Region Covered by LACNIC
      [5]

   o  RIPE NCC: No known policy at this time.

5.2.  Possible Operational Impact(s)

   A DNS delegation of a child-zone by lame NS records in the parent-
   zone will result in partial or complete failure of the child-zone.

   Therefore, removing these lame records at the parent will have no
   further adverse affects on the child zone.

   In the case of partial lameness, where not _all_ name-servers are
   found to be lame, the impact will be positive: The removal of failing
   delegations will result in no DNS failures, rather than partial.

                           AFPUB-2017-{.....}

Abstract

   This policy is intended to address lame DNS delegations specific to
   the in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa DNS hierarchies, as applicable to
   records for IP resources in the AFRINIC region.

1.  Problem Addressed by this Policy

1.1.  Background: What is "Lame Delegation"?

   In the DNS, generally, a lame delegation is a type of error that
   results when a name server which is designated as the authoritative
   server for a domain name, when queried, does not have authoritative
   data for that name.

1.2.  Impact of Lame Delegations in the Global DNS

   In the in-addr.arpa and ip6.arpa zones, as applicable to this policy,
   the DNS records considered are NS records, delegating authority
   further down the chain of authority.

   With such a delegation resulting in a lame responses, the most
   obvious issue is complete failure for the specific arpa. sub-zone
   below being delegated to.

2.  How this Policy Addresses the Problem

2.1.  Summary

   Overview of monitor, alert, disable/remove process and phases

2.2.  Scope of the Policy

   Some text stating this covers in-addr.arpa only, and only for
   resources managed by AFRINIC.

3.  Policy

   The actual policy (solution) follows here.  Maybe start with an intro
   line or two again.

3.1.  Process Detail

3.1.1.  Monitor

   Monitor for x-time,etc.

3.1.2.  Notify

   Detail about how/how often to try get in touch with resource holder
   or whoever

3.1.3.  Remove Delegation

   Details about what happens next

3.1.4.  Re-instate

   How does a resource holder re-add a non-lame delegation.  Just point
   to existing docs.

3.2.  Situation in other RIRs

   Self explanatory section.  Reference links below.  Might be better
   versions, needs some more searching.

3.3.  Pros and Cons

   Some stuff about what the impact may or may not be, to what and to
   whom.

# AFRINIC Public Policy Proposal(s)

## What is here?

**Lame Delegation in reverse DNS policy: [afpub-2017-lame-dns](afpub-2017-lame-dns-draft-00.md)**

## Notes:

* These are working edits and drafts of a policy proposal for AFRINIC. (This is one easy(ish) way to collaborate: Git. In the ‚òÅÔ∏è).

* All documents and texts here are considered **works in progress**. Once finalised they'll be discussed and published on the relevant mailing-lists and web-sites.

## How do co-authors or other contributors make edits?

1. Fork. Edit the Markdown (`*.md`) file(s). Don't make the text or html versions.

2. Make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests). (Yes, a [Github](https://github.com) account is needed.)

## What else is needed?

Documents here are written in what is essentially [MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (with some extensions), intended to be processed into XML by [Mmark](https://miek.nl/tags/mmark) by Miek Gieben, and then on to text and html.

Therefore, if you want to rebuild text or html files for your own viewing:

* Install mmark from here: [github.com/miekg/mmark/releases](https://github.com/miekg/mmark/releases)

* The syntax is documented here: [github.com/miekg/mmark/wiki/Syntax](https://github.com/miekg/mmark/wiki/Syntax)

* You'll then also need [xml2rfc](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org). Easily installable also with `pip install xml2rfc`.

(Although *obviously* not *actual* RFCs, the `private="yes"` PI flag keeps the content things generic, but very nicely formatted! üëçüèª)

In addition, a nice MarkDown editor is [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/)

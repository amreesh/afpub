# AFRINIC Public Policy Proposal(s)

## List of current work:

* Lame Delegation in reverse DNS policy: [afpub-2017-lame-dns](afpub-2017-lame-dns)

## What is this stuff, really?

* Working edits and drafts of policy proposals for AFRINIC go in here. (It's easy(ish) to collaborate this way. Git. In the cloud).

* All documents and texts here are considered **works in progress**.

* Each policy draft/proposal should go into a sub-folder. Current docs actively being worked on should be listed above. (Assuming no one forgot to update the README).

## How do you make edits?

You fork and make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests). You should have a Github account.

## What else do you need?

Documents here are written in what is essentially [MarkDown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), intended to be processed by [Mmark](https://miek.nl/tags/mmark) by Miek Gieben.

* Install it from here: [github.com/miekg/mmark/releases](https://github.com/miekg/mmark/releases)

* The syntax is documented here: [github.com/miekg/mmark/wiki/Syntax](https://github.com/miekg/mmark/wiki/Syntax)

* You'll also need [xml2rfc](https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org)

In addition, a nice MarkDown editor is [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/)
